## Effective Design Principles

### Content Organization

* **Content-rich slides** with 3-5 key points per slide rather than 1 point per slide
* **Progressive disclosure** using animations to control focus
* **Visual hierarchy** to indicate importance of information

### Visual Elements

* **Consistent visual language** across all slides
* **Meaningful visuals** that support your points
* **Examples and screenshots** to illustrate interactions
* **Clear, readable charts** with annotations

### Effective Communication

* **Assertion-evidence model**: Make slides with clear assertions supported by evidence
* **Precise terminology**: Use "interaction styles" instead of "personalities"
* **Context-setting** for each major section

### Research Presentation Best Practices

* **Clear connections** between research questions and findings
* **Proper citations** of key literature and concepts
* **Balance** between technical depth and accessibility
* **Anticipate questions** with backup slides
