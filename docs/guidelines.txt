Garden Metaphor
This visual metaphor uses a garden to represent your AI ecosystem:

You as the gardener nurturing different tools
Embodied experience as the watering can that helps everything grow
Journey path showing your evolution at the bottom
Self-connection as the sun that nourishes everything

Best for: A holistic view that emphasizes how all elements work together
