Okay, so I am giving a presentation tomorrow about how people use, or how I use AI systems to live a better life. And there are different kinds of tools, flows, and other things. In all of them, I am going to discuss the tools.
So just imagine, there is the obvious language model, Claude, there is Perplexity, exa.ai, voicenotes.com. elicit Hmm. What is it? Hmm.
In the end, I will write like a, so for search, it's either Perplexity, or exa, someone elicit that's it. For thinking, there are a lot of creative ways in which I use. Claude. Hmm.Oh yeah Cursor Coding environment. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

I'm gonna use excalidraw for the presentation, but in a simple way, I'm very  though, so the tools are super important, right? But so is how one uses them, and like imagination, right? So I think I want to maybe have some like trigger action plans, maybe framing from that, like heuristics, like if this happens, do X, if that happens, do X, kind of like that, you know? Yeah.

So what's the idea? If I have something and I want something similar to it, like a person, some idea, some blog post, some paper, some organization, I go to exa.ai for similarity. This is what I want, I know what I want, find more of this. Here is like one point in the subspace I am looking at, find more points in the subspace.For perplexity, it basically replaces Google for me. In a Google search, I am collecting information. There is a shallow one there and there is the deep research one.On Ellicit, I generally go and have questions that I know can be described scientifically.

So even here, I don't just want to advertise like 10 different tools. I want to talk about how AI has meaningfully improved my life, right? And when I think about it, it's not very much like a bunch of different tools. It's about understanding what I need. And then building my environment.
So that made a really good example is voicenotes.com, which got me over my writing psychological barriers, as well as my writing physical barriers, like carpal tunnel syndrome. So that has been hugely helpful to me. And then I can talk about what that has led to like my sensemaking documents, for example. Yeah.

What else? Cursor is making it really easy for me to liberate myself through coding. Two good examples are I really dislike presentations, specifically making slides. I hate it, I am absolutely horrible at it, especially the slides that are, you know, typical kind of slides. I just don't know how to make them.
And recently I had to make some slides for my master's thesis presentation which couldn't be like this, which had to be quite formal, and I was banging my head over it. I realized that even though AI dudes are bad at making PowerPoint presentations, they are amazing at writing code. I have really good flows with writing code through AI and also writing code myself.
What if instead of doing stuff in a PowerPoint file, what if I just built a website that can be viewed as a presentation and I used AI to help me then design those slides? The content of the slides is still all me, it's my thesis, it's my research, it's my narrative, but it helps me present them. So what ended up happening was I created this flow on cursor where now I have this kind of template code base where I put in my coding files or my research files, whatever documents are useful as context, and then through the chat I describe which ideas to begin from, which content, how I want the aesthetic to look like, what I want it to signal, what things I want to emphasize, which ones I don't, and then through chat you basically use all of this information to create a website and then put it online.
And I did that and then I used that same template for my life theory presentation which is a reusable component now, and my slides here are much better than whatever I could have hoped to achieve by myself. Now I'm not at all worried about future professional presentations because I know that I just need to take care of the content, and putting it into a slide format I have a really good flow for that now which people love and which I also love.

Another example for code liberating me was I use Goodreads a lot. I have over 2,000 books on it and I read a lot of books. The problem I've had is that I have this phase as well. I'm like exploring something and so I encounter a lot of books around that and then I add all of them to my to-read shelf.
All right. So there probably like if you sort my to-read shelf by date added, you'll see like groups of books about similar themes or maybe, I don't know, violence or trauma narratives or computing in like the 1960s, you know, random stuff like that. It's all of them. What happens is, I mean, it gets really hard for me to come back and be like, okay, I have these 2,000 books which won't vary. And even if I have preference of like, oh, I would like to read a book about this kind of vibe or this kind of subject, how am I going to find it among this curated list that I've already created? It's just 2,000. There is no meaningful field transfer ability here.
Okay. This description of this problem is getting too long. I don't want to stick to this. But anyways, what I did was, I've been wanting to improve for a lot of time, years. And it's fucking stagnated. It's really irritating. So what I did, and like, this is a thing that software people do all the time. When they don't like something, then they kind of wanted to build it themselves.
What I want to point out is how easy it is to do that now. Potentially also for non-software and non-coding people and how liberating that is. What I did was, I took all of my Goodreads data, which Goodreads allows to export, and using cursor, so it's an AI, coding assistant, basically created this super small app or website where I can export my Goodreads data. And it puts all of it into this embedding space. And then I can do semantic search over it. And that's fascinating. That is lovely. So now when I have some thoughts or ideas, I first go to this and see if there are like any books that I've already, the past versions of me have already been like, hey, this is a cool book you might want to try this, rather than going again to the internet to find stuff.

One lovely thing has been the sense making documents as well. For the last six-eight months I've had this like documents, Google Docs. Let's write out my thoughts over time on work, human connection, my physical health. I have like two to three games and I either do it either through writing or through taking voice notes.
And this is, I've written in the last six months more than I've ever written in my life. And now when I have this like six-month data, which is super low effort and it's an experience in itself, so I don't find value in itself anyways, I'm able to just like plug in those Google Docs into cloud. And be like hey, these are my journal entries from the last six months. What patterns do you notice? Can you apply some personal development framework, some psychology and see what my journal entries tell about me.
Some super interesting things that happened was recently Cloud identified how I was thinking about my work back in March 2024-October, like around that time, but specific journal entries from there and then recently March 25 again when I was thinking about some stuff last week. And it identified how the thoughts I was having last week had evolved from the thoughts I was having in the past, the words I was using were different, the ways in which I was talking about my work and my relationship to it was different. And it wasn't different in a very like, you know, just like completely separate, but it was different in the sense of we could see how my thinking had evolved bit by bit day by day over the last year and we could map out how that made sense, how the problems that I was thinking about last year and engaging with them was what was making me think about theâ€”okay, I don't want to go into the specifics of this, but you understand like the thing I'm trying to say here.
Like these language models are allowing me to connect through time to myself, connect to my past versions, trust that my future versions will also connect to me in ways that seem very meaningful to me and ways that seem insightful and useful, stuff like that.


'm curious if there's something else popping up. I think I want to, you know, there are some obvious questions that get asked or that get, that arise when one thinks about augmenting oneself using AI is that Are you Delegating skills That you shouldn't be delegating, for example Are you automating stuff that you shouldn't be automating, right? Another one is Are you somehow Through using AI having less meaning in your life rather than more Less experiences, less meaning Yeah Yeah, I mean, I have like really I also think there are like more questions that come up in this scenarios. But yeah, I think it would be nice of me to like Have some angle there because I mean last year I Was getting a lot of, I was delegating a lot of thinking to AI I was also delegating my writing to AI and I noticed that there was a problem And I shifted now all of my writing is AI, all of my thinking is also AI. An example here is that When I'm trying to think through stuff, I either write a bunch of things and then I Send all of my writings To cloud and just like see its reflections Rather than ask, so my content, my inspiration, my thought structures are still the primary Object that we're engaging with. Or what I do is instead of reflection If I'm like not sure how to think I'm like a bit more hazy And these are scenarios when I think we generally tend to just you know, pick to what the AI is saying What I ask instead is, what I describe is my What I'm confused about Or just like try to express my confusion and be like Can you suggest me different structures? That can help me think here So sometimes it suggests, you know, broken columns or mind maps or they're like what-if scenarios from like design and there's so many different things and They're pretty standardized in a bunch of different industries and stuff, right? So I'm often able to pick out a structure, but I'm like, oh, yeah, this would be really cool for me to think in Given what's like muddling around in my body right now And so then I take that structure and then I like think in it and And that's helpful in a song then maybe I ask for reflection once I'm done thinking and that's like really good as well I think the reflection stuff is important because When you ask for reflection from your friends, you know, you share your thoughts with your friends You do want to have that back and forth you do want to hear from like different perspectives you do wanna Be able to Help others see or make you see stuff that you weren't seeing right like I described how AI helps me connect through my past thoughts In better ways, AI helps me apply like interesting frameworks to my thoughts and Sort of like help me see my thoughts through that lens and infer some interesting things. That's not possible just by myself That's a proper augmentation that's grounded in me


Some other stuff that's going on in my mind is I'd love to maybe mention some open problems for me, right, that I'm still like working through. I think I want to do more of building custom solutions, custom prototypes. I think I am underestimating or I'm not. I only recently started doing that.Something I'm thinking about is I'm still quite afraid about using cursor and losing my and having it affecting my coding skills. It's still like a tension in me about how much are these coding skills going to remain important versus how much is it more useful to just you know work on the higher level of abstraction and really build competence there because now we can assume this as a given similar to how no one's punch cards anymore, you know, you don't think about compilers when you're writing code, you know, think about binary, etc.This is like the next stage of the abstraction-laden programming. I see that but I'm also cautious and I'm not really sure how to think about it yet. Yeah, that's one at least.



Yeah now this is good the evolution of my approach. I think in one of the previous messages I talk about how in the past I was noticing that I was delegating my thinking to AI, delegating my thinking to AI.
For example in my work I was writing code which I didn't understand. I tried to automate my whole master's thesis writing process using AI where I created this whole workflow where it would read some relevant papers, not it would extract highlights, my highlights from some papers, find things within those highlights, read my existing master's thesis draft, integrate those highlights into those, suggest me areas for my improvement, then I would like read some more papers now highlight them and then like continue continue continue. For a bunch of like all these reasons that wasn't a really smart thing to do but that was kind of one stupid thing I was doing.
I was also at some point only doing voice notes and so what I was noticing was I got really really good at getting in touch with my thoughts and what's coming up for me but not really good atâ€”but then I would like say those things and then let AI write for me and I'd like structure them for me and I noticed that I got really bad at structuring and I would feel super comfortable babbling but I wouldn't feel comfortable communicating my thoughts clearly. Yeah that's still something I'm exploring honestly.

The physical versus digital boundaries is interesting. It has changed my relationship. I noticed that I'm much more, you know, like I'm walking around more because like voice is the primary way I'm like dealing with content and digital tools. I'm walking around more. I can just like, if I want a thing go to a coffee shop or like go to a park. I just like record a bunch of voice notes on my phone. I don't need to sit in front of a screen hunched down in the same chair, so that has been lovely. As long as I have a device that can record my voice I can be anywhere and I'm like super comfortable with it.
Now when you ask me about quality assessment, how do you evaluate whether an AI augmented solution is actually better than what you could produce otherwise? So again, I'm not trying to get towards outputs from the answer, right? But an easy answer is the amount I've written in the past six months is more than I've ever written and explicitly thought. Right, I'm creating custom solutions for things I care about which I would rarely do in the past or if I would do it would take me a long-ass fucking time in comparison.
Another one is because it's so easy for me to deceive good answers to my questions I am following my curiosity a lot more. If I'm thinking about something, I follow through on it. If I'm confused about something, I actually just go on and like deconfuse myself about it. There is much less of a consideration of oh, this is what I've had. Ah interesting. I don't know. Let's move on because if I should try to follow it, it'll take me like, you know, I don't have that much time to look up stuff on the internet. I'm not looking up stuff on the internet anymore. So that barrier to engaging your curiosity with the world is lower, which is amazing.

I also think there is a relationship I am cultivating with our past selves that feels more whole than the alienation I used to feel in the past before these old things where who I am now is me and the way I think now it makes sense to me and sort of like, you know, I basically forget how I used to think one year ago, I can maybe remember some rock times but I don't really have a deep relationship with that person, he made me who I am but that's it, that's sort of like a goodbye to him, as soon as I left his moment.
And with this voice notes thing I am like, there seems to be a stronger relationship like my future self cares about my past self and my past selves trust my future self and there seems to be a more cohesive, collaborative bond for me. This is new to me, I don't know what this means but yeah.


I think with the initial journey finding balance, one way I self-correct and find balance here is, partly helped through the voice notes, is that I am like very deeply attuned to my moment-to-moment experience and also my more longer time frame experiences where I notice if I start feeling disempowered or if I start feeling like hey something's not right here or dissociated or even like good, liberated, free and being connected to those very subtle feelings, signals gives me this base confidence that if something is going wrong, how am I going to know about it? It's going wrong with me for my experience, right? So my experience is going to let me know. That's it. And it does.
